/**
 * Rendering the traceability matrix.

 * Two shapes, one row-builder underneath:
 *
 *   - the MASTER matrix, one row per criterion across the whole application, written to
 *     a committed file so it diffs in review like anything else;
 *   - a CHANGE matrix, the same rows filtered to what a given change touches, for the
 *     pull request body.
 *
 * The matrix is generated, never hand-edited. The authored decisions live in the plan's
 * own Traceability Matrix (which AC belongs to which plan item, and which tasks build and
 * prove it); this file is that expanded, cross-referenced against the suite, and marked
 * with what is actually true right now.
 *
 * It reports COVERAGE as well as gaps. A list of only what is wrong cannot answer "is
 * this good enough to ship" — that needs the proportion proven, and it needs the gaps
 * ranked, because a test that proves the wrong thing and a test with an untidy name are
 * not the same problem and should never be summed into one number.

**Feature**: ${generatedFor}
**Criteria**: ${rows.length} across ${new Set(rows.map((r) => r.story)).size} User Stories

${renderCoverage(rows)}

A row is one *criterion*: an Acceptance Criterion that asserts one thing, or one Case of
an AC that asserts several. 🖵 marks a criterion that describes something a person sees or
does, which cannot be proved by a test with no document to look at.

## How a gap is ranked

Severity comes from the kind of gap, not from a judgement recorded per criterion, so it
cannot be talked down when a deadline is close.

| Severity | Gap | Why it ranks there |
|---|---|---|
| **CRITICAL** | NO TEST — nothing names this criterion | Nobody has looked. This is the state an unbuilt requirement sits in. |
| **HIGH** | WRONG TEST — a test names it but proves something else | The claim is unproven while reporting as covered. This is what hid US-2.2 and US-11.1/11.2. |
| **HIGH** | NOT PROVABLE — UI-level, but only a pure unit test | Same failure, arrived at differently: \`core/\` cannot see a screen, whatever the test is named. |
| **MEDIUM** | NEEDS CASES — a compound AC not decomposed | Partly proven. One test stands in for several claims, so some of them are unchecked. |
| **LOW** | MISNAMED — right test, named in its own words | Proven. Clerical: the name has drifted from the spec's wording. |

**WAIVED** marks a gap deliberately left open, with its reason shown in the row. Only LOW
and MEDIUM may be waived — CRITICAL and HIGH are exactly the states that let unbuilt work
report as complete, so no reason clears them (Constitution Principle IV).

ᵃ marks a gap accepted as pre-existing debt (${accepted} rows). It is reported but does not
fail the build, and it is outstanding work — never a settled decision.
